SARAH's THOUGHTS ON WHAT EACH PROGRAM TELLS US ABOUT THE LANGUAGE.

hello_world.alice - x said Alice means print string x. what was z? means get z from user input.
data_types.alice  - x thought Alice. means a comment
                  - new data types = string and array. x had size type. means declaration of an array x that has size(variable/integer) of type (char/letter/string). To access an entry in an array its x's number peice... where number is the index.

veryLargeLoop.alice - eventually (CONDITION) because LOOPCODE enough times.
simpleButNiceLoop.alice - didn't deduct anything new
short_circuit.alice - if then else is either(CONDITION) so THENCODE or ELSECODE Alice was unsure which. single if (i.e. without an else) is perhaps (CONDITION) so THENCHODE Alice was unsure.

looking_class.alice - x went through fn means call fn with parameters x. Its a function. To define a function do "The Looking-Glass addAnswer changed a number". think changed a number is return type?

input.alice - learn nothing knew. consolidates that what was x? means get input from console and assign it to x.

conidtional.alice - perhaps is if or maybe is else if or is else.
